                AACreations is a team of siblings, Aarav and Advaita Sheel Parida, united by a passion for
                technology,
                innovation, and making a difference. We create impactful projects that solve real-world problems,

                begins with a strong Project Planâ€”brainstorming ideas, careful planning, and precise execution, with
                tasks divided to play to our strengths. Our mission is to develop technologies that benefit humanity
                while continually learning and growing. Alongside our tech pursuits, we've launched two apps on the
                Play
                Store and share a love for outdoor adventures, including hiking mountains together.
